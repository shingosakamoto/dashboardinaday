## Dataset
The dataset you will you use for the Dashboard in a Day class is a sales and market share analysis. 
This type of analysis is very common for a Chief Marketing Officer (CMO). Unlike the Chief Financial 
Officer (CFO), a CMO is focused not only on the companyâ€™s performance internally (how well do our 
products sell) but also externally (how well do we do against competing products). 

The company, VanArsdel, manufactures expensive retail products that can be used for fun as well as 
work. This company sells their products directly to consumers nationwide as well as in several other 
countries.
